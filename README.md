### Hi, I'm Akash 👨‍💻🏌️‍♂️🚴‍♂️🍕💤

I am a student at UIC studying computer science. I love making Android Applications integrating machine learning, and one of my proudest projects is making an android app that takes pictures of wildlife when the camera detects them.
<br>
<br>
This is how felt when I actually made this project work.

This is how I chose that my next project will be in AngularJS
